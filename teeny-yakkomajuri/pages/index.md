    <summary>What is this website?</summary>
    <p>
    This <s>is</s> hopefuly will be where I host my "stream of
    consciousness" blog. My more structured and education-focused
    technical writing can still be found
    <a href="https://yakkomajuri.medium.com/">here</a>.

    <summary>Why is it called 'Sunday Afternoon'?</summary>
    <p>
    Sunday afternoons are often when I'm most contemplative, as well as
    when I generally have the most time to spare. They have
    traditionally been when I develop my best concepts for writing, so
    the blog name felt appropriate. The bulk of the time I spend on this
    blog will also probably happen on sunday afternoons.
